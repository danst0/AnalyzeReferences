Tactical supply chain planning in the forest
products industry through optimization and
scenario-based analysis

Daniel Beaudoin, Luc LeBel, and Jean-Marc Frayret

Abstract: A mixed integer programming model that aims at supporting the tactical wood procurement decisions of a
multifacility company is presented. This model allows for wood exchanges between companies. Furthermore, the mate-
rial flow through the supply chain is driven by both a demand to satisfy (“pull” strategy) and a market mechanism
(“push” strategy), enabling the planner to take into consideration both wood freshness and the notion of quality linked
to the age of harvested wood into log, chips, and end-product demands. An inability to consider alternative plans for
implementation, and the difficulty of assessing the performance of these plans in an uncertain environment, are two
shortcomings of the manual planning process. A planning process, based on human planner – decision support system
interactions that allows a company to overcome these shortcomings is therefore presented. The process combines
Monte Carlo methods and an anticipation mechanism that will, in the long term, enable the company to take into ac-
count equipment transportation costs. The proposed planning process leads to a multicriteria decision-making problem
where the human planner has to select a plan to implement from a set of candidate plans. A hypothetical test case
shows that it is possible to manage the wood flow from stump to end market in such a way as to preserve freshness
and extract higher value from the logs processed in the mills. The test case also shows that the proposed planning pro-
cess achieves an average profitability increase of 8.8% compared with an approach based on a deterministic model us-
ing average parameter values. Finally, a sensitivity analysis reveals that the accuracy of standing inventory on harvest
blocks and the anticipated market conditions are the most important parameters to consider in selecting a good wood
procurement plan.

Résumé : Cet article présente un modèle qui utilise la programmation linéaire mixte pour résoudre le problème de pla-
nification tactique des approvisionnements forestiers d’une entreprise propriétaire de plusieurs usines. Le modèle per-
met les échanges de bois entre compagnies. Les flux de matériaux à travers le réseau d’approvisionnement sont dictés
tant par la demande à satisfaire (stratégie en flux tirés) que par un mécanisme de marché (stratégie en flux poussés).
Ces stratégies permettent de tenir compte de la fraîcheur du bois et de la notion de qualité associée à l’âge du bois
dans les demandes de billots, de copeaux et de produits finis. L’incapacité de considérer l’implantation de plans alter-
natifs et la difficulté d’évaluer la performance de ces plans dans un environnement incertain sont deux points faibles
d’un processus manuel de planification. Un processus de planification permettant de surmonter ces lacunes est présenté.
Ce processus est basé sur les interactions entre une personne et un système d’aide à la décision. Il combine les métho-
des Monte Carlo et un mécanisme d’anticipation qui permet à l’entreprise de tenir compte des coûts associés au dépla-
cement des équipements. Le processus de planification proposé prend la forme d’un problème de prise de décision
multicritère pour lequel le planificateur sélectionne un plan à implanter parmi un ensemble de plans candidats. Une
étude de cas démontre qu’il est possible de gérer le flux de bois de la forêt jusqu’au marché, de manière à préserver sa
fraîcheur et extraire plus de valeur des billots transformés aux usines. Aussi, les résultats d’une simulation démontrent
que le processus de planification proposé permet d’augmenter les profits de 8,8 % en moyenne par rapport à une ap-
proche basée sur un modèle déterministe utilisant la valeur moyenne des paramètres. Finalement, une analyse de sensi-
bilité révèle que la précision de l’inventaire des volumes sur pied présents sur les parterres de coupe et l’anticipation
des conditions de marché sont les paramètres les plus importants pour établir un bon plan d’approvisionnement.

Introduction

Wood procurement planning is a complex task, as a multi-
tude of factors must be taken into account. It is even more
complex in a multifirm environment, where firms may sup-
ply each other, and where forest stands are composed of sev-
eral tree species. Yet planning is still largely done on the
basis of intuition and without mathematical programming
support. Furthermore, the considerable amount of time re-
quired to build a single plan precludes the evaluation of al-
ternative plans.
The contributions of this paper are (i) a detailed tactical
model to support centralized annual planning by an inte-
grated forest company that may own many mills, and allows
for wood exchanges between companies; (ii) an extension of
the market mechanism presented in Maness (1989) to antici-
pate market needs, taking wood freshness into account;
(iii) a planning process, that is, a process for generating and
evaluating candidate plans.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: a lit-
erature review is presented in the next section, followed by a
description of the problem. The planning process is then in-
troduced with its different components. Then the mathemati-
cal formulation of the tactical wood procurement model is
shown. Following this is a description of a hypothetical test
case. Finally, the results and concluding remarks are pre-
sented.

Literature review

Models
The use of mathematical models to deal with wood pro-
curement problems can be traced back to the early 1960s.
Since that time, a large body of models has been developed
to address different aspects of wood procurement. Some
have been designed for specific activities such as skidding
(Carlsson et al. 1998) or transportation (Wightman and Jor-
dan 1990; Weintraub et al. 1996). Others have integrated
several activities within a single model to capture possible
synergies between them. For instance, Burger and Jamnick
(1995) integrated harvest, storage, and transportation deci-
sions, while Karlsson et al. (2004) included allocation of
harvest teams in addition to these factors. To our knowledge,
no attempt has been made to address these decisions while
taking into account mills’ anticipated production decisions,
even though significant gains could be achieved through an
increase in fiber freshness (i.e., a decrease in time elapsed
between harvesting and processing at the mill).

Deteriorating items
In the last decade the industry has come to realize the im-
portance of procuring fresh fiber. Common problems associ-
ated with log storage are check development due to drying,
and sap stain. Even if sap stain does not change the struc-
tural integrity of the wood, it can severely affect its appear-
ance, resulting in serious loss of value (Kreber et al. 2001).
Laganière and Defo (2002) looked at the impact of timber
freshness for sawmill operators. They identified problems
associated with the log yard, debarking, sawing, drying,
planing, and grading. They concluded that for all activities,
older fiber is detrimental to a sawmill’s performance. Simi-

129

larly, Bicho (2002) and Wood (2002) discussed the impact
of storage duration on pulp yield, pulp brightness, and pro-
cessing costs of pulp mills.
Production planning and scheduling of deteriorating items
have long been the subject of articles, but such consider-
ations have appeared only recently in models dealing with
the problem of harvest and distribution planning. Karlsson et
al. (2003) were among the first to introduce age-related stor-
age costs. In their model, fiber deterioration is taken into ac-
count by associating a reduction in value for different log
assortments and different total storage times. Two improve-
ments can be made to this approach. First, the reduction in
value does not take into consideration the seasonal variation
in the rate of deterioration of the fiber. It is not only the time
elapsed between the moment a tree is harvested and the mo-
ment it is transformed into diverse products that should be
considered, but also the periods or seasons over which the
elapsed time occurs. Second, their model considers the rate
of deterioration to be the same regardless of the storage lo-
cation and the end products to be manufactured. Storage lo-
cations are sometimes far apart, and even if the seasonal rate
of deterioration is the same, the season may begin at differ-
ent times across the land base. Furthermore, mills may use
different technologies and may not be affected in the same
way by the freshness of the resource. The mathematical for-
mulation proposed in this paper takes these considerations
into account.

Uncertainty
Forest managers and researchers are increasingly con-
cerned with uncertainty and would like to account for it
when making decisions. Weintraub and Bare (1996) and
Martell et al. (1998) identify wood procurement planning
under uncertainty as a new challenge for researchers. To
date, the majority of models tackling the wood procurement
problem have focused on deterministic formulations of the
problem. A fundamental property of deterministic models is
that all required data are supposed to be known with cer-
tainty. This is an important assumption that limits the valid-
ity of any linear programming solution to a supply chain
problem (Shapiro 2001). The main criticism of these appli-
cations concerns not necessarily the use of deterministic de-
cision models in nondeterministic environments but rather
the lack of focus on analysis and validation of the so-called
optimal solution. Contingency analysis is a necessary step
before any decision is made.
Relatively few studies that consider the role of stochastic
conditions in addressing wood procurement problems have
been undertaken. For a review of stochastic parameters and
approaches adopted in order to take uncertainty into consid-
eration, we refer the reader to Weintraub and Bare (1996)
and Martell et al. (1998). The most commonly used method-
ologies are “one at a time” sensitivity analysis and scenario-
based analysis. One at a time sensitivity analysis is a
point-by-point change that consists of varying the value of a
parameter to find the extent to which the change affects the
outcome, while scenario-based analysis is a process of ana-
lyzing potential future events by considering possible alter-
native outcomes. Major drawbacks of these two methods are
their inability to evaluate the impact of the interactions be-
tween the various stochastic parameters and a lack of knowl-

edge concerning the probability of occurrence of each
scenario. An adaptation of the two-stage stochastic decom-
position method presented in Goetschalckx et al. (2001) per-
mits these shortcomings to be overcome.

Description of the problem

The problem we consider is that most productive forested
land is within the public domain. This land base is divided
into procurement areas. Government allocates volumes of
timber to mills through timber licenses (TL). A TL is
awarded to a mill regardless of its ownership. A TL speci-
fies, on a yearly basis, the areas from which wood for the
mill can be procured, with predefined volumes of one or
more resource types (tree species). A mill may hold a TL on
more than one procurement area, and several TLs may be
awarded to different mills on the same procurement area,
even for the same tree species. Sharing a procurement area
means that in a single block, harvested volumes are sorted
according to their characteristics and their suitability for
manufacture into certain product types (such as softwood
lumber, hardwood lumber, pulp, and veneer) so that they can
be delivered to the appropriate mills. Furthermore, even if
most companies manage their own operations, part of their
requirements for raw materials must be met through the pur-
chasing of logs from other companies’ operations, owing to
the mixed nature of stands. These relationships are charac-
terized by pooled-type dependencies, also called resource-
sharing dependency (Frayret et al. 2004), and must be man-
aged by coordinating procurement activities. To supply its
mills, a company must coordinate its operations in several
procurement areas and with those of other companies.
The problem at hand is to maximize a firm’s profit while
satisfying demand for end products and wood chips covered
under agreements or contracts, and demand for logs from
other companies. The model proposed here takes into ac-
count volume restrictions based on the origin of the wood
over the land base and the deterioration of fiber, which af-
fects the net revenue obtained from the sale of end products.
The developed model addresses the problem of tactical
wood procurement planning. We assume that a strategic plan
has been previously executed. The output from this process
is a 5 year development plan that identifies blocks to be har-
vested in each of the 5 years. The annual plan includes more
details surrounding activities on blocks identified for har-
vesting in the first year of the 5 year development plan. It is
assumed that volumes of each resource on every block are
known. A resource is defined by type and quality by the
government in order to determine stumpage fees. It should
be noted that stumpage fees for the same resource are fixed
over a tariff zone but vary from one zone to another. A pro-
curement area may cover more than one tariff zone.

Market-anticipation functions
Minimizing procurement costs while satisfying mills’ de-
mand is an adequate objective from a supplier’s point of
view. However, in an integrated wood production system it
seems to be short-sighted. As outlined by Gingras and
Sotomayor (1992), increased procurement costs would be
acceptable and justifiable to preserve fiber quality as long as
the incurred cost is offset by a reduction in processing costs

at the mill or by a gain in revenue from the sale of products
and by-products. Therefore, our model attempts to integrate
harvesting decisions with anticipated log distribution and
mills’ aggregated production planning. Because only part of
a mill’s production capacity is covered by long-term con-
tracts with customers, the use of the excess capacity must be
planned in order to provide end products to the open market.
The market mechanism presented by Maness (1989) has
been adapted to take fiber freshness into consideration and is
illustrated in Fig. 1.
Market-anticipation functions are used to estimate which
aggregated levels of production at the mills are the most
profitable in order to guide upstream operations. Such a
function uses valuation levels. A valuation level represents
the average unit revenue from the sale of a particular end
product made from a given resource, minus its average pro-
cessing cost. The valuation level is constrained by the maxi-
mum number of units that can be sold at that valuation level.
As availability increases within an age class, the valuation
decreases, reflecting the lower confidence one may have that
all of the end products to be produced can be sold. Age
classes are bounded by a lower value and an upper value and
do not have to be homogeneous in length. Valuation levels
are defined for each age class. Variation over age classes re-
flects the processing cost and quality of the end products.
The older the fiber used, the lower the expected profit mar-
gin on the end product. Deterioration of wood fiber is thus
taken into account through a reduction in value.
Yang et al. (1999, 2001) indicate that the degree of deteri-
oration may vary with the season, tree species, local environ-
ment, and storage conditions. Thus, a market-anticipation
function is required for each resource in every season in or-
der to take into consideration the seasonality of the deterio-
ration rate and the market price of the end product.
Moreover, every mill may have its own market-anticipation
functions because of differences in the end products being
manufactured or the technology being used.

Planning process

Among the shortcomings of a manual planning process
are its inability to consider alternative plans for implementa-
tion and the difficulty involved in assessing the performance
of these plans in a stochastic environment. The proposed

planning process (Fig. 2) is an adaptation and extension of
the two-stage stochastic decomposition method developed
and presented in Goetschalckx et al. (2001). The proposed
planning process overcomes both of these shortcomings.
The mathematical deterministic model that follows does
not address robustness explicitly. Rather, the proposed plan-
ning process makes use of a set of mechanisms to assess a
posteriori how several alternative plans meet some key ob-
jectives. The proposed planning process starts by creating
scenarios by randomly generating values for the uncertain
parameters for each period considered in the model, based
on their given probability distribution functions. For each
scenario the optimal plan (referred to as the candidate plan)
is determined by solving a deterministic mixed integer pro-
gram. Each candidate plan is then further analyzed by
(i) subjecting it to the harvest block sequencing and equip-
ment transportation anticipation model in order to evaluate
the operational equipment transportation cost of the plan and
(ii) simulating it using different scenarios. In each of these
steps, statistics are gathered to help the planner resolve the
resulting multicriteria decision problem.

Scenario generator
Uncertainty is inherently present in a wood procurement
network. Scenarios are generated using the Monte Carlo
method. This is useful for evaluating interdependencies
among random effects that may cause serious degradation in
performance even though the average performance charac-
teristics of the system’s components appear to be acceptable
(Shapiro 2001). The Monte Carlo method uses probability
distribution functions of key factors of uncertainty in the
supply chain to generate random variables.

Deterministic wood procurement planning model
For each scenario a deterministic mixed integer program
is used to find the optimal plan. Each scenario corresponds
to an optimal plan (i.e., the candidate plan). In this model
(see the next section), because of block sizes, which range
from a few hectares to over 100 ha, and the desire to reduce
inventories, preemption is allowed in regard to harvesting
(i.e., a block does not have to be harvested all at once).

131

Harvest block sequencing and equipment
transportation anticipation model
Owing to the highly combinatorial nature of the block se-
quencing problem, equipment transportation cost is not in-
cluded in the tactical model. Instead, this cost is taken into
account by anticipating, for each candidate plan, the opera-
tional model’s output for the sequencing problem. The pur-
pose of this model is to minimize a firm’s equipment
transportation cost while harvesting targeted volumes identi-
fied per period in the candidate plans. The model identifies
an operational plan that takes into account the time that
equipment spends harvesting and moving from one block to
another. The model is designed to address particularly the
problem of harvest block sequencing and equipment trans-
portation. For more details about this aspect of the planning
process, the reader is referred to Beaudoin et al. (2005).

Rule-based simulation
Rule-based simulation aims at assessing how a given plan
unfolds if different scenarios occur. Instead of randomly
generating new scenarios to evaluate each candidate plan,
we used those previously generated, as suggested by Novak
and Ragsdale (2003). In their work, those authors reformu-
late the problem before reevaluating candidate solutions un-
der alternative scenarios. This reformulation is necessary to
avoid violating the flow-conservation constraints. To avoid
this reformulation we use a rule-based simulation approach.
More specifically, rules are defined in terms of “if–then”.
These rules adjust the values of output variables so as to re-
spect the capacities and other parameters of the scenarios.
For example, let us say that the plan under consideration
identifies a target of 500 m3 to be harvested on a specific
block, but under the current scenario that block holds only
450 m3. The harvest variable for that block is then adjusted
downward in order to respect the capacity of the block. In
cases where there is no breach in capacity, no adjustment is
required. The same rule also applies to the transportation,
storage, and milling variables of the candidate plan. Since
activities along supply chains are highly dependent, flow-
balancing adjustments are also required to reflect previous
adjustments.

Decision-making
Finally, different metrics are calculated and gathered in
order to assess each plan and support decision-making.
These metrics include the average and standard deviation of
profit, the equipment transportation cost, the volumes to be
acquired from private woodlot owners, and the feasibility of
the plan. Volumes to be acquired from private woodlot own-
ers correspond to the missing volumes of resources needed
to satisfy demand for end products and wood chips. Mean-
while, if demand for logs from other companies cannot be
met by the company’s operations according to the terms
agreed upon, then the plan is deemed infeasible. This indica-
tor captures the risk associated with a plan due to the propa-
gation of the stochastic effects throughout the network of
interdependent companies. It should be noted that the met-
rics used for decision-making are not restricted to those pre-
sented here. Any metrics representing the preferences of the
decision-maker could be accommodated through the pro-
posed planning process and its constituents.

The proposed planning process thus provides insights into
the system’s performance, something that cannot be obtained
by using deterministic optimization models on their own.
The planner then faces a multicriteria decision problem in
selecting a candidate plan for implementation. Here the pro-
cess is applied to plans generated with a deterministic opti-
mization model. It can also be applied to plans generated
intuitively by the planner or strictly based, for example, on
the planner’s experience.

Decision variables
Decisional variables and their relations with one another
are summarized in Fig. 3, which illustrates the centralized
planning problem from a firm’s perspective.
Decision variables are divided into two distinct categories:
primary decision variables and anticipated or secondary de-
cision variables. Primary decision variables are those that
the planner is responsible for instantiating. Anticipated deci-
sion variables are needed to coordinate tactical decisions
with operational decisions that will eventually be taken to
operationalize the tactical plan. In other words, these sec-
ondary decision variables only represent an aggregated an-
ticipation of operational decisions for which the planner is
not directly responsible.

Objective function
The objective function is a linear profit maximization
equation. Revenues are derived from the sale of lumber and
wood chips on the open market. Lumber and chips are al-
ways sold during the period when they are produced. Note
that revenues associated with the sale of logs and end prod-
ucts covered under agreements, as well as costs incurred to
buy logs from other suppliers, have been omitted from the
objective function, since they are irrelevant to the decision
problem at hand. They are covered under binding contracts
and are thus parameters of the problem. The first term in
eq. 1 represents the total revenues from the sale of excess
end products on the open market, net of the mill’s process-
ing costs. The second term corresponds to revenue from the
sale of wood chips. It is assumed that all chips produced are

sold to a single client, therefore the same rate is applied to
every unit of chips produced.
Even if revenues from the sale of logs are irrelevant to
decision-making, it is important to take into account the
costs incurred to satisfy these demands, as contracts specify
the unit price agreed upon for delivery of the volumes of de-
sired logs. By satisfying the demands of low-cost operations,
a firm may increase its profit. The third and fourth terms ac-
count for harvesting costs and stumpage fees. Harvesting
costs include all activities from stump to roadside. The fifth
and sixth terms correspond to transportation costs from the
forest to the mills, i.e., owned and others’ mills, respectively.
Storage costs are accounted for in the last two terms of
eq. 1.
This model sets production targets per period. The length

of a period is such that more than one block can be visited
within it. The scheduling of blocks, or the sequence in
which blocks are harvested within a period, is dealt with at
the operational level, as it requires consideration of each
contractor’s capacity and each scheduling alternative.

Constraints
Equation 2 ensures that harvested volumes on a block do
not exceed availability. Equations 3 through 5 are used to
avoid excessive equipment transportation needs. Equation 3
assigns a value to the binary variables, while [4] and [5]
limit the number of periods over which harvesting can occur
on block i and the number of blocks on which harvesting
can occur during period t, respectively. Each mill is limited
in the volume of a given resource type that it can receive
from a specific procurement area, as outlined in its TL. The
first term of eq. 6 refers to volumes delivered from the firm’s
own operations, while the second term corresponds to vol-
umes bought from other suppliers working in the procure-
ment areas covered by the firm’s TL. The latter are known
because they are specified in pre-existing contracts between
two firms. They are important to take into account, since
they will have an impact on the volumes that can be deliv-
ered to the firm’s mills from its own operations.
Next, production constraints limit total production capac-
ity. Equations 7, 8, and 9 represent the total harvesting,
transportation, and individual mill processing capacity, re-
spectively. Aggregated harvesting and transportation capaci-
ties are considered, rather than those of an individual
contractor, since no contractor scheduling is attempted.
Equations 10a through 11c represent classical flow-
conservation constraints. Our formulation of the problem
uses a discrete notion of time, where the age of harvested
wood, a, and period, t, are expressed in the same unit (i.e.,
weeks). As soon as standing timber is harvested, it is as-
signed an age of 1 period (week). The age of the harvested
timber increases with the passing of periods. In eqs. 10a and
11a, no inventory is held from period t – 1 because the con-
straints concern the stocking of harvested wood at a = 1,
which means that the wood is stored during the same period
it is harvested. Equations 10c and 11c allow for transition
between subsequent planning horizons. Our formulation of
the problem takes into account storage in locations of two
types: roadside and mill yard. Storage at roadside is virtually
unlimited, involves no capacity constraint, and could easily
be added if required. Storage capacity at the mill is limited
according to eq. 12. Finally, to allow planning to ensure ade-
quate safety stocks of resources, eq. 13 sets a minimum level
of inventory to be maintained at a mill at the end of a given
period.
A firm must satisfy demands for various commodities:
logs, end products, and chips. Demands originate from con-
tracts and are considered to be binding. No penalties are in-
curred for delayed deliveries or lack of freshness. However,
these may be added as presented in Wee and Wang (1999).
This study models a production-inventory system for deteri-
orating items with time-varying demands and completely
backlogged shortages.. Satisfaction of the demand for logs,
end products, and chips is expressed by eqs. 15, 16, and 17,
respectively. Also, because these commodities are used by
mills for which the quality of the input has a direct impact

on the performance of their processes and the quality of
their end products, mills have specific requirements regard-
ing the freshness of their input. Our model does not distin-
guish between end clients,
since delivery costs are
voluntarily omitted. Also, storage and related deterioration
of end products are not considered, although this would be
possible as presented in Maness and Norton (2002). Market
conditions for end products are modeled using market-
anticipation functions. These functions use valuation levels
that are bounded by a maximum volume of end product that
can be sold, as represented in eq. 14.

Description of a hypothetical test case

For the computational experiment, a hypothetical but real-
istic test case has been developed on the basis of one firm’s
data from the Mauricie region in Quebec, Canada. It repre-
sents a situation typical of several forest companies. The
company operates two softwood lumber mills within the
same region. The mills are provided with raw material from
the company’s forest operations and from outside suppliers
(other companies’ operations). The list of blocks included in
the case study corresponds to the blocks planned to be har-
vested in the first year of the 5 year development plan. Ta-
ble 1 gives an example of data used in the case study.
The block number, its related procurement area, and the
available volume of each resource are given. In the hypothet-
ical test case, 50 blocks are eligible for harvesting during the
year. Each block holds a specific volume and composition of
resources; 14 different resources are considered, each be-
longing to one of four tree species present. Planning is done
for the whole year, which is divided into 28 periods that vary
in duration. Also, 11 different ages are considered, to repre-
sent differences in fiber freshness, and these are grouped
into three age classes. Furthermore, four valuation levels are
considered for each age class in a market-anticipation func-
tion.
The hypothetical test case is defined by nearly 300 000
continuous and 1400 binary variables and more than
100 000 constraints. Through Monte Carlo sampling and us-
ing probability distribution functions (see Table 2), two dis-
tinct sets of scenarios have been generated. The first set is
used to evaluate the deterministic tactical wood procurement
planning model and the proposed planning process. This set
contains 11 scenarios, one of which, referred to as the aver-
age scenario (scenario 11), uses the average values of the
distribution. The second set, which contains 330 scenarios,
is used to perform sensitivity analysis. The objective of sen-
sitivity analysis is to identify the stochastic parameters that
would lead to the greatest reduction in the variance of the re-
sponse (objective function). Variance is a proper measure of
sensitivity if the intention is to rank the input parameters in
order of importance, even if the model is nonadditive and
the impact parameters are correlated (Saltelli 2002).
Only standard deviations expressed as a percentage of the
average value are presented in Table 2, to preserve the confi-
dentiality of operations and costs. Standard deviations for
stumpage fees and valuation levels have been assigned in-
creasing values over time to reflect the fact that uncertainty
increases as an event becomes more distant in time.

Results and discussion

Deterministic wood procurement planning model
The deterministic problems were solved with CPLEX 9.1
on a 2.00 GHz Pentium 4 personal computer with 1.00 GB
of RAM memory. It took less than 5 min to solve each of
them within a relative gap of 5%. Computing time makes it
conceivable to use the proposed model on a regular basis to
generate many candidate plans and also to use it with a roll-
ing horizon in order to periodically adjust the procurement
plan when new developments must be considered.
Age tracking, along with market-anticipation, is effective
in managing the wood flow from the forest to the mill to
maximize value. As is shown by Fig. 4, the age of volumes
planned to be processed through the mills is coherent with
the valuation function provided for the hypothetical test
case. More than 67% of the total volume is 1 week old or
less and close to 85% is 2 weeks old or less. The model has
also been tested with bell-shaped valuation functions charac-
terizing processing costs at an oriented strand board (OSB)
mill. Similar proportions were obtained with the bulk of pro-
duction at and around the preferred freshness.

Simulation
To assess the impact of uncertainty, each candidate plan
has been evaluated under alternative scenarios using the
rule-based simulation approach described previously.
Through the simulations, metrics pertaining to average and
standard deviation of profit, volumes to be acquired from
private woodlot owners, and the feasibility of the plan have
been gathered.
Average profits and their standard deviations are plotted in
Fig. 5 for comparison. Analysis using both metrics helps
draw a more comprehensive picture of the range of profits
and, thus, the associated financial risk that can be expected
from the implementation of a plan.

owners.

Fig. 5. Profitability of the average plan, with the associated stan-
dard deviation (2σ).

Two conclusions can be drawn from Fig. 5. First, the aver-
age plan is not the most profitable: 4 of the other 10 plans
show higher profits. On average, plan 9 should generate
$467 000, or 8.8% more profit than the average plan. Sec-
ond, the range of profits that can be expected from the im-
plementation of a plan varies greatly from one plan to
another when evaluated from the same scenario sample. Plan
5 shows less variability around the mean than any other
plan, while the variability of plans 7, 9, and 10 is over twice
that of plan 5. The average plan shows 71.6% higher vari-
ability than plan 5.
For every plan, the average volumes that are missing and
therefore have to be made up in order to satisfy agreements
to supply end products and wood chips are presented in
Fig. 6. It is important to note that, in general, the implemen-
tation of any plan requires the purchase of wood volumes
from private woodlot owners even if the original problems
were constrained to satisfy all demands. This is a direct re-
sult of the uncertainty associated with capacities and pro-
cessing yields. In most cases, an appropriate level of safety
log yard inventory should absorb these fluctuations. Again,
based solely on this metric, the average plan is not the best,
since 4 of the other 10 plans require the purchase of lesser
volumes.
The feasibility of these plans is shown in Table 3: this
metric identifies the proportion of scenarios under which a
given plan remains feasible. Feasibility varied greatly from
one plan to another. Plan 7 showed little overall feasibility.
Still, several plans remained fully feasible in all scenarios. In
contrast, the average scenario performed poorly, showing
feasibility in only 50% of the scenarios.

Decision-making
At the end of this planning exercise, a plan has to be se-

lected for implementation. Figure 7 presents the set of candi-
date plans to be considered. In the case of a multiobjective
optimization problem, a multitude of solutions may be con-
sidered feasible. However, only a subset of these solutions is
of interest. The subset of nondominated solutions forms the
trade-off surface (Pareto front), represented by the thick line
in Fig. 7. A solution is said to dominate another if it is not
worse on any objective and better on at least one objective.
In our hypothetical test case, only candidate plans 3, 5, 8,
and 9 are nondominated and deserve further analysis. The
other metrics described previously can be used, for example,
to rank nondominated plans according to the decision-
maker’s preferences. However, consideration of recourse
actions could attenuate the importance of the financial risk
criterion used in identifying the Pareto front by providing
opportunities not considered in our approach that could gen-
erate higher profitability. Multicriteria decision-making be-
ing outside the scope of this paper, we refer the reader to
Collette and Siarry (2004) for further details on the subject.
Further testing using a larger number of scenarios would be
required to determine if the average plan would always be
among the dominated solutions.
Once a plan has been picked for implementation, other in-
formation can be advantageously used.
For example,
harvesting and transportation capacity requirements in each
period can be extracted and utilized to adjust available ca-
pacity by hiring or dismissing contractors when possible.
Also, unused mill processing capacity is identified and can
be used to determine the volume of logs to be purchased
from private woodlot owners and to schedule delivery time.

Sensitivity analysis
The objective of sensitivity analysis was to rank the sto-
chastic parameters in order of importance to identify the
ones that would lead to the greatest reduction in the variance
of the response. Table 4 presents the ranking of the parame-
ters along with the calculated variance of the system’s re-
sponse.
The results must be interpreted carefully, since they only
apply to the system being observed and reflect the probabil-
ity distribution functions used to represent the uncertainty of
the parameters. These distributions were estimated on the
basis of the planner’s experience, since no database with this
information was available. Any change in a characteristic of
a given distribution function may have an effect on the cal-
culated variance associated with that parameter and its rank-

ing. Table 4 clearly shows that the most important parameter
in determining which is a good plan is our knowledge of the
standing inventory on the harvest block, followed by market
anticipation. This observation is in line with the desire to
plan production (wood procurement and mills) according to
market conditions in order to create the most value (i.e.,
generate higher profitability).
It is also worth noting that within the first four ranked pa-
rameters, all functional boundaries (procurement, mill pro-
cessing, sales/marketing) from stump to final product are
represented. This confirms the importance of integrating de-
cisions across all functions, as proposed in the tactical wood
procurement planning model in this paper.
Based on the hypothetical test case, none of the plans pro-
vide the entire volume of fiber to which the mills are entitled
to under their TL. This cannot be attributed to harvesting or
transportation capacity, since used capacity is lower than, or
equal to, available capacity in every period. Also, according
to market valuations of end products manufactured by the
mills, it should be advantageous for the mills to process all
the fiber they are allowed to. The problem arises from the
fact that most stands to be harvested are mixed, which
means that several tree species are present on the same
block. A mill may have rights to only some of them, while a
harvesting cost and stumpage fee are incurred for all the vol-
umes harvested, regardless of whether they are required or
not. Unless the undesirable or excess harvested volumes are
to be delivered to other companies’ mills, it is uneconomical
to harvest. These stands become economically viable only if
the undesirable volumes, along with their associated costs,
can be passed to another firm. This highlights the joint de-
pendency of companies sharing a procurement area. It also
serves to demonstrate the importance of collaboration be-
tween these firms in order to optimize their operations.

plex process. This paper introduces a detailed model that
supports centralized wood procurement planning by a com-
pany which may own many mills, and allows for wood ex-
changes between companies.
We have presented an
extension of the market mechanism of Maness (1989) that
takes into account both fiber freshness and the notion of
quality linked to the age of the fiber. We have also presented
a planning process that permits the generation and evalua-
tion of alternative plans in an uncertain environment.
The results show that it is possible to manage the fiber
flow from stump to end market taking its freshness into ac-
count in order to extract higher value from the logs pro-
cessed in the mills. Close to 85% of the total volume
planned to be processed at the mill sites is 2 weeks of age or
less, meaning that even in the warmer months of the year, fi-
ber deterioration is limited.
Plans developed with the deterministic model can be sen-
sitive to a change in a parameter’s value. Therefore, a plan
chosen for implementation may not remain the best alterna-
tive if unfolding events cause parameter values to differ sig-
nificantly from those that were expected.
However,
a
computing time of less than 5 min makes it conceivable to
use the proposed model with a rolling horizon in order to pe-
riodically adjust the procurement plan when new develop-
ments must be considered, and even to directly consider
recourse in the simulation-based analysis of robustness.
Nowadays, planning is still largely done using intuition,
with little, if any, mathematical programming support. Yet
examples of benefits can be found in the literature, suggest-
ing an increase (decrease) in profits (costs) averaging 5%
when decisions are supported by deterministic mathematical
programming (Burger 1991; Williamson and Nieuwenhuis
1993; Hecker et al. 2000; Bergdahl et al. 2003). Testing the
described planning process in a hypothetical test case per-
mitted the identification of a plan that generated an average
of 8.8% more profit than the average plan found using the
proposed deterministic model alone. This result enables us
to anticipate the significant benefits that could be obtained
by using the proposed model and planning process rather

than the manual planning process. However, the potential
benefits are highly dependent on such factors as the spatial
distribution of harvest blocks and mills, stand composition,
the number of beneficiaries on the same procurement areas,
and the level of uncertainty.
The results also demonstrate that using a deterministic
model in a nondeterministic environment can give rise to false
expectations, thus stressing the importance of analyzing and
validating the so-called optimal plan. Based on our hypotheti-
cal test case, the optimal deterministic plan is not the optimal
plan when uncertainty is considered. Also, the optimal deter-
ministic plan does not satisfy all demands when it is simu-
lated in different scenarios, even though it was constrained to
do so in the development of the plan. Moreover, it gives no
indication of the financial risk, nor of the risk associated with
the feasibility of the plan that is incurred through its imple-
mentation. A plan obtained by optimizing average parameter
values should not be considered the optimal plan to be imple-
mented as is. It should, rather, be looked upon as a first-cut
solution, or merely a plan on which to build.
In addition, consideration of recourse actions could atten-
uate the importance of the financial risk criterion used for
identifying the Pareto front by providing opportunities not
considered in our approach. These new opportunities could
generate higher profitability. Therefore, a recourse mecha-
nism will be included in the planning process in order to
make new planning decisions as events unfold, as in Myers
(2004).
Also, the proposed formulation of the deterministic model
allows us to take into account final agreements between
companies. Yet the complex dynamic of the interaction among
companies when negotiating agreements deserves further re-
search.
Finally, the deterministic model presented in this paper,
when used in combination with the harvest block sequencing
and equipment transportation model introduced in Beaudoin
et al. (2005), allows for cost/value analyses. These analyses
will examine trade-offs between an increase in equipment
transportation cost and reductions of costs incurred by hold-
ing inventories, lost opportunities, and loss of value caused
by fiber deterioration.
